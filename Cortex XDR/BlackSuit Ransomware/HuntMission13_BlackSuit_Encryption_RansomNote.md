# Detection of BlackSuit Ransomware Encryption and Ransom Note Creation

## Severity or Impact of the Detected Behavior

- **Risk Score:** 98
- **Severity:** Critical

## Hunt Analytics Metadata

- **ID:** HuntQuery-Windows-BlackSuit-Encryption-RansomNote
- **Operating Systems:** WindowsEndpoint, WindowsServer
- **False Positive Rate:** Low

---

## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects file events indicative of ransomware encryption (such as new file extensions and mass file writes) and the creation of BlackSuit ransom notes (`README.BlackSuit.txt`). These are hallmarks of BlackSuit’s dual encryption and ransom strategy. Detected behaviors include:

- File write events for `README.BlackSuit.txt` (ransom note creation)
- File write events for files ending with `.blacksuit` (encrypted files)
- Full process, file, and user context for investigation

These techniques are associated with data encryption for impact and ransomware operations.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies ransomware encryption and ransom note creation by looking for:

- File write events for `README.BlackSuit.txt`
- File write events for files ending with `.blacksuit`
- Full process, file, and user context for triage

These patterns are indicative of BlackSuit ransomware activity.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** XQL (Cortex Query Language)
**Platform:** Polo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and XSIAM

```xql
// Title: BlackSuit Ransomware Encryption and Ransom Note Creation
// Description: Detects file events indicating encryption (e.g., new file extensions) and the creation of BlackSuit ransom notes (README.BlackSuit.txt).
// MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID: T1486

config case_sensitive = false
| dataset = xdr_data
| filter agent_os_type = ENUM.AGENT_OS_WINDOWS
    and (
        // Detect ransom note creation
        (event_type = ENUM.FILE and event_sub_type = ENUM.FILE_WRITE and action_file_name = "README.BlackSuit.txt")
        // Detect encrypted file creation (files ending with .blacksuit)
        or (event_type = ENUM.FILE and event_sub_type = ENUM.FILE_WRITE and action_file_name contains ".blacksuit")
    )
| fields _time, agent_hostname, actor_effective_username, action_process_image_name, action_process_image_path, action_process_image_command_line, action_file_name, action_file_path, event_id, agent_id, _product
| sort desc _time

## Data Sources

| Log Provider   | Event Name   | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Cortex XSIAM   | xdr_data     | File                | File Creation, File Write |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must have privileges to write files on the system.
- **Required Artifacts:** File creation and write logs, process context, and file path information.

---

## Considerations

- Review the source and context of the file write events for legitimacy.
- Correlate with user activity and process logs to determine if the activity is user-initiated or automated.
- Investigate any subsequent data loss, encryption, or ransom activity.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- IT administrators or backup tools create files with similar names or extensions for legitimate purposes.
- Automated deployment tools or scripts generate and write these files for benign reasons.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the process and file write events for intent and legitimacy.
2. Review user activity and system logs for signs of compromise or ransomware activity.
3. Analyze any subsequent data loss or ransom note creation.
4. Isolate affected endpoints if malicious activity is confirmed.
5. Block or monitor access to suspicious file write patterns and known ransomware indicators.
