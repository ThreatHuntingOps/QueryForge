# Detection of Execution of vmware.dll via rundll32.exe

## Severity or Impact of the Detected Behavior

- **Risk Score:** 90
- **Severity:** Critical

## Hunt Analytics Metadata

- **ID:** HuntQuery-Windows-Rundll32-vmwaredll-StartW
- **Operating Systems:** WindowsEndpoint, WindowsServer
- **False Positive Rate:** Low

---

## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects the execution of `vmware.dll` using `rundll32.exe`, specifically with the `StartW` export, a behavior associated with Cobalt Strike and BlackSuit ransomware payloads. Attackers often use `rundll32.exe` to execute malicious DLLs as part of post-exploitation and lateral movement. Detected behaviors include:

- Process launches of `rundll32.exe` with command lines referencing `vmware.dll` and the `StartW` export
- Full process and user context for investigation

These techniques are associated with process injection, defense evasion, and post-exploitation activity.

| Tactic                        | Technique   | Subtechnique | Technique Name                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| TA0002 - Execution           | T1055.001   | —            | Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection |
| TA0005 - Defense Evasion     | T1218.011   | —            | Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32        |

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies suspicious DLL execution by looking for:

- Process starts of `rundll32.exe` with command lines referencing `vmware.dll` and `StartW`
- Full process and user context for triage

These patterns are indicative of Cobalt Strike or BlackSuit payload execution via DLL injection.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** XQL (Cortex Query Language)
**Platform:** Polo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and XSIAM

## Data Sources

| Log Provider   | Event Name   | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must have privileges to execute rundll32.exe and load DLLs.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process creation logs, command-line arguments, and process ancestry information.

---

## Considerations

- Review the source and context of the rundll32.exe process and command line for legitimacy.
- Correlate with user activity and system logs to determine if the activity is user-initiated or automated.
- Investigate any subsequent lateral movement, malware activity, or persistence mechanisms.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- IT administrators or legitimate tools use rundll32.exe to execute benign DLLs with similar command lines.
- Automated deployment tools or scripts generate and execute these commands for legitimate purposes.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the process and command line for intent and legitimacy.
2. Review user activity and system logs for signs of compromise or lateral movement.
3. Analyze any subsequent network connections or file transfers.
4. Isolate affected endpoints if malicious activity is confirmed.
5. Block or monitor access to suspicious rundll32.exe usage and known malicious DLLs.
