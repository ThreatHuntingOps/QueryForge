# BlackSuit Ransomware Threat Hunting Hypothesis

## Source
- **Threat Intelligence:** [Cybereason: BlackSuit – A Hybrid Approach with Data Exfiltration and Encryption](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/blacksuit-data-exfil)
- **Date:** August 2025

## Hypothesis Statement

> **BlackSuit ransomware operators may be present in the environment, conducting multi-stage attacks characterized by initial access via unknown vectors, lateral movement using Cobalt Strike and PsExec, data exfiltration with renamed rclone utilities, selective data deletion, and partial file encryption using the -nomutex flag. These activities can be detected through analysis of network connections to known C2 infrastructure, process execution patterns, file system changes, and credential access attempts.**

## Rationale

- **Specific and Actionable:** Focuses on BlackSuit’s unique TTPs, including the use of Cobalt Strike, renamed rclone, and the -nomutex flag.
- **Based on Threat Intelligence:** Derived from Cybereason’s incident analysis and observed behaviors.
- **Testable:** Can be validated by searching for specific network, process, and file system indicators.

## Testable Elements

- **Network:** Connections to known C2 IPs/domains (e.g., 184.174.96[.]71, misstallion[.]com).
- **Process:** PowerShell and PsExec activity, execution of renamed binaries (e.g., rclone as vmware.exe), use of -nomutex flag.
- **File System:** Creation of README.BlackSuit.txt, selective encryption patterns, vssadmin shadow copy deletions.
- **Credential Access:** LSASS memory access and dumping, code injection into wuauclt.exe.

## Success Criteria

- **Positive:** Detection of one or more BlackSuit TTPs or IOCs in the environment.
- **Negative:** No evidence of BlackSuit-related activity.
- **Inconclusive:** Partial indicators requiring further investigation.
