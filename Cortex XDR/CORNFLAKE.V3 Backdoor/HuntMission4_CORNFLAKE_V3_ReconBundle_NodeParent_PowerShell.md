## Hunt Analytics
This hunt detects a characteristic reconnaissance bundle executed via PowerShell that is spawned by a staged Node.js binary associated with CORNFLAKE.V3. The activity typically originates from `%APPDATA%\\node-v22.11.0-win-x64\\node.exe` invoking PowerShell (often via `execSync`) to run a rapid sequence of discovery commands:

- `chcp 65001` to set UTF-8 code page
- privilege/runas echo lines (e.g., `Runas: Admin`, `Runas: User`, `Runas: System`)
- `systeminfo`
- `tasklist /svc`
- PowerShell cmdlets: `Get-Service | Select-Object ...`, `Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem ...`
- `arp -a`

This pattern commonly appears shortly after Node self-respawn and initial staging, and helps confirm post-compromise discovery driven by the CORNFLAKE.V3 payload.

## Hunt Query Logic
Flags PowerShell (or PowerShell Core) processes whose command lines contain any of the recon-bundle indicators and whose parent/causal lineage includes `%APPDATA%\\node-v22.11.0-win-x64\\node.exe`.

## Execution Requirements
- **Required Permissions:** Standard user capable of running PowerShell; elevation not strictly required for discovery.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process creation telemetry with full command line and causal lineage fields.

---

## Considerations
- Recon commands in rapid succession from a Node parent under `%APPDATA%` are strong indicators of post-compromise automation.
- Pair this detection with the Node self-respawn and initial delivery hunts for correlated triage.
- Consider time-window grouping (e.g., alerts for multiple recon hits within 1â€“2 minutes for the same host/user) to reduce noise and show campaign context.

---

## False Positives
- Admin or IT scripts may perform similar discovery, but the lineage to `%APPDATA%\\node-v22.11.0-win-x64\\node.exe` is atypical for legitimate activity.

---

## Recommended Response Actions
1) Investigate lineage:
   - Validate the parent `node.exe` path and any preceding staging events (download/extract under `%APPDATA%`).
2) Scope discovery:
   - Identify the full set of commands executed and any outbound connections following discovery.
3) Contain and eradicate:
   - Isolate endpoint; remove `%APPDATA%\\node-v22.11.0-win-x64\\` artifacts; block `node.exe` execution from user profiles.
4) Fleet-wide hunt:
   - Search for similar PowerShell recon bundles with Node parent across endpoints.
