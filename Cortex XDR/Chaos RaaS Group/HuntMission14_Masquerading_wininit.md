## Hunt Analytics

This is a broader, behavioral hunt query that detects a key defense evasion technique: masquerading. The legitimate Windows Initialization Process, `wininit.exe`, should only ever execute from the `C:\Windows\System32` directory. This query identifies any process named `wininit.exe` that runs from any other location. This is a powerful and high-confidence indicator of compromise, as it directly points to an actor attempting to hide their tools by naming them after a critical system process. This would detect the Chaos group's TTP as well as other unrelated malicious activity.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies process masquerading by looking for a simple but powerful anomaly:
- A process with the image name `wininit.exe`.
- An image path that is anything other than the legitimate `C:\Windows\System32\wininit.exe`.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** XQL (Cortex Query Language)
**Platform:** Polo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and XSIAM

```xql
// Title: Masquerading wininit.exe Execution from Non-Standard Location
// Description: Detects the execution of a process named "wininit.exe" from any path other than the legitimate C:\Windows\System32 directory, a strong indicator of process masquerading.
// MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID: T1036.005

config case_sensitive = false 
| dataset = xdr_data 
| filter event_type = ENUM.PROCESS 
    and event_sub_type = ENUM.PROCESS_START 
    and agent_os_type = ENUM.AGENT_OS_WINDOWS 
    and action_process_image_name = "wininit.exe" 
    and action_process_image_path != "C:\Windows\System32\wininit.exe" 
| fields _time, agent_hostname, actor_effective_username, action_process_image_name, action_process_image_path, action_process_image_command_line, actor_process_image_name, actor_process_image_path, actor_process_command_line, causality_actor_process_command_line, causality_actor_primary_username, causality_actor_process_image_sha256, event_id, agent_id, _product

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |

| Cortex XSIAM | xdr_data         | Process             | Process Creation       |

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** The attacker must have permissions to place and execute the masquerading binary on the host.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process creation logs with full command-line argument and process path visibility.

---

## Considerations

- **High Fidelity:** This is a very high-confidence alert. There are no legitimate reasons for `wininit.exe` to execute from a non-standard directory.
- **Key Artifacts:** The process path (`action_process_image_path`) and the file hash (`causality_actor_process_image_sha256`) are the most critical artifacts for investigation and further hunting.
- **Parent Process:** The parent process (`actor_process_image_name`) will reveal how the malicious binary was launched.

---

## False Positives

- False positives are extremely rare and would likely point to a misconfigured or poorly written legitimate application, which itself may be a security concern. Any alert from this query should be treated as a true positive until proven otherwise.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1.  **Isolate Host:** Immediately isolate the host to prevent further malicious activity.
2.  **Collect Artifacts:** Collect the masquerading `wininit.exe` binary (and its hash) for forensic analysis.
3.  **Investigate Causality:** Analyze the parent process to understand how the malicious binary was placed and executed on the system.
4.  **Hunt for Hash:** Use the file hash of the malicious binary to hunt for its presence on other systems in the environment.
5.  **Remediate:** Proceed with full incident response and remediation procedures for a compromised host.
