## Hunt Analytics

This hunt is designed to detect the final stage of the HazyBeacon attack: evidence removal. The query identifies the use of common command-line tools (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) to delete the specific payloads and artifacts associated with the attack from the `C:\ProgramData` directory. Detecting this cleanup activity is a strong indicator that a compromise has already occurred and the attacker is actively trying to cover their tracks to evade forensic investigation.

Detected behaviors include:
- Process execution of `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`.
- Command line containing a deletion command (`del` or `Remove-Item`).
- The target of the deletion command is one of the known HazyBeacon payload files or a `.zip` archive in the `ProgramData` path.

This technique is a key part of the Defense Evasion tactic.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies post-exploitation cleanup by looking for:

- `PROCESS_START` events on Windows endpoints.
- The acting process is `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`.
- The command line includes `del` or `Remove-Item`.
- The command line also references one of the known HazyBeacon payload paths in `C:\ProgramData` or a `.zip` file, which is used for staging.

A match for this logic is a strong indicator that an attacker is performing cleanup actions on a compromised host.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** XQL (Cortex Query Language)  
**Platform:** Polo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and XSIAM

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |

| Cortex XSIAM | xdr_data         | Process             | Process Creation       |

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** The attacker must have permissions to delete files in the `C:\ProgramData` directory.
- **Required Artifacts:** Endpoint logs capturing process creation events with full command-line arguments.

---

## Considerations

- An alert from this query is a "trailing indicator," meaning the primary malicious activities (collection, exfiltration) have likely already occurred.
- The investigation should immediately pivot to a full incident response to determine the scope and impact of the breach.
- Check for file deletion events in addition to process creation events if your EDR provides them, as this can offer more direct evidence.

---

## False Positives

- False positives are very low. Legitimate scripts or users should not be deleting these specific, maliciously-named files from the `C:\ProgramData` directory.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1.  Isolate the affected endpoint immediately to preserve any remaining forensic artifacts.
2.  Trigger a full incident response procedure.
3.  Assume the host was fully compromised and data was exfiltrated. The primary goal is to determine *what* was taken.
4.  Review all preceding activity on the host to reconstruct the entire attack chain.
5.  Expand the investigation to other hosts to check for similar activity, as the attacker may have moved laterally.
