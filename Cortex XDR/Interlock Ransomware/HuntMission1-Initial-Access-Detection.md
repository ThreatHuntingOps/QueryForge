## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects suspicious initial access activity associated with Interlock ransomware, focusing on sophisticated social engineering and payload delivery methods. Detected behaviors include:

- Drive-by downloads leading to execution of suspicious payloads
- Payloads masquerading as browser or security software updates (e.g., `chrome_update.exe`, `windowsdefenderupdate.exe`)
- Execution of Base64-encoded PowerShell commands, often delivered via clipboard or CAPTCHA-based social engineering
- PowerShell processes leveraging clipboard access (indicative of user-pasted payloads)

These techniques are commonly used by Interlock ransomware operators to gain initial access and execute malicious code on victim endpoints.

## ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic                     | Technique   | Subtechnique | Technique Name                        |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| TA0001 - Initial Access   | T1189       | —            | Drive-by Compromise                   |
| TA0001 - Initial Access   | T1204.004   | —            | User Execution: Malicious Script      |

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies suspicious process launches by looking for:

- Process names matching known fake browser or security software update payloads
- PowerShell or pwsh processes with Base64-encoded command-line arguments (using `-enc`)
- PowerShell or pwsh processes that access the clipboard (using `Get-Clipboard`), a common sign of social engineering payload delivery

These patterns are indicative of initial access attempts leveraging social engineering and masquerading techniques associated with Interlock ransomware.

## Data Sources

| Log Provider   | Event Name | ATT&CK Data Source | ATT&CK Data Component |
|----------------|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Cortex XSIAM   | xdr_data   | Process            | Process Creation      |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to execute processes and PowerShell scripts.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process creation logs, command-line arguments, and clipboard access records.

---

## Considerations

- Review the source and context of the process and command line for legitimacy.
- Correlate with user activity, web browsing, and download logs to determine if the activity is user-initiated or automated.
- Investigate any network connections or downloads associated with the detected processes for signs of malicious payload delivery.
- Validate if the process or payload is associated with known Interlock ransomware indicators or threat intelligence feeds.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Users or IT staff legitimately use update tools with similar names.
- PowerShell scripts are used for legitimate automation that leverages Base64 encoding or clipboard access.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the process and command line for intent and legitimacy.
2. Analyze network connections and file downloads associated with the detected process.
3. Review user activity and system logs for signs of social engineering or compromise.
4. Isolate affected endpoints if malicious activity is confirmed.
5. Block or monitor access to suspicious update payloads and PowerShell executions.
