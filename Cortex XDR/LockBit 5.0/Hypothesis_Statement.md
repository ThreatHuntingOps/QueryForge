# Hypothesis: LockBit 5.0 multi-platform ransomware activity is present in the environment

## Statement
If LockBit 5.0 affiliates are operating in our environment, then within a contiguous 24–72 hour window we will observe a correlated sequence of behaviors across Windows endpoints, Linux servers, and VMware ESXi hosts that includes:
- Obfuscated execution and in-memory loading (e.g., DLL reflection/Assembly.Load or heavy packing) with anti-analysis steps such as ETW patching (EtwEventWrite overwritten with 0xC3) and termination of security services.
- Mass file encryption evidenced by randomized 16-character appended extensions and subsequent event log clearing.
- Ransom note deployment (e.g., ReadMeForDecrypt.txt) and, in some cases, desktop wallpaper modification on impacted Windows systems.
- For ESXi infrastructure: targeted encryption of VM-related files consistent with a single-host, multi-VM impact scenario.

## Rationale
Trend Micro reports that LockBit 5.0 exhibits:
- Heavy obfuscation and payload loading via DLL reflection, with anti-analysis including ETW patching and termination of security services.
- Randomized 16-character file extensions for encrypted files and event log clearing post-encryption.
- Cross-platform variants (Windows, Linux, ESXi) enabling simultaneous enterprise impact, with ESXi specifically designed to encrypt virtual machines at scale.
These behaviors provide specific, testable signals observable in EDR/XDR telemetry, file system events, and hypervisor logs.

## Scope & Assumptions
- In-scope assets: Windows workstations/servers, Linux servers, VMware ESXi hosts.
- Time horizon: 30 days lookback for breadth; 24–72 hour windows for correlated activity.
- Data sources assumed available: endpoint EDR/XDR telemetry (process, file, registry), Windows Event Logs, Linux audit/file events, hypervisor/ESXi logs, network logs (optional), central log management/XDR search.

## Testable Predictions (Observables)
1. Windows execution + evasion
   - Command lines containing indicators of reflection or obfuscation: `Assembly.Load`, `System.Reflection`, base64-like blobs, references to `EtwEventWrite`, or presence of 0xC3 patching behavior in relevant tools.
   - Service tampering commands (e.g., sc.exe/net.exe stop; taskkill /f) focused on AV/EDR/backup keywords.
2. File encryption markers
   - Spikes in FILE_WRITE/RENAME events where filenames end with a randomized 16-character alphanumeric extension.
   - Creation of ransom notes (e.g., ReadMeForDecrypt.txt) in impacted paths.
   - Event log clearing activity (wevtutil clear-log; PowerShell Clear-EventLog).
3. Linux targets
   - Process execution with verbose/invisible modes and directory targeting options consistent with Trend Micro’s findings (e.g., CLI-driven selection of encryption targets/exclusions).
4. ESXi impact
   - Host-level activity targeting VM-related directories/files indicative of mass VM encryption from a single ESXi host.

## Data Requirements
- Endpoint process telemetry: image, command line, parent, signature, integrity level, user, timestamps.
- File telemetry: create/write/rename events with full path and post-operation filenames.
- Registry (Windows): set value operations under wallpaper/desktop keys (for impact UI changes).
- Windows logs: Security, System, PowerShell, and Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog operational.
- ESXi logs or SIEM ingest from vCenter/ESXi.

## Analytical Approach (High Level)
- Create phase flags per host/process:
  - Evasion flag: process events with ETW patching strings (EtwEventWrite, 0xC3) and anti-debug (`IsDebuggerPresent`, `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent`).
  - Obfuscation flag: base64-like strings; reflection keywords; API resolution indicators (GetProcAddress, LoadLibrary, VirtualAlloc, CreateThread).
  - Encryption flag: files renamed/written with 16-char extensions; ≥N files per process/host (tune N based on environment baseline).
  - Ransom note flag: creation of ReadMeForDecrypt.txt (or decrypt/ransom/readme patterns).
  - Impact flag: event log clearing, wallpaper changes.
- Correlate: Require Encryption flag AND at least two of {Evasion, Obfuscation, Impact} within 24–72h on same host/process tree. For ESXi, flag large-scale VM file encryption from a single host.

## Measurement of Success
- True positives: Confirmed ransomware activity with correlated phases and artifacts (encrypted files with 16-char extensions + ransom notes).
- False positives minimized by excluding common system binaries (svchost/explorer) and standard system paths, and by requiring correlation across phases rather than single indicators.
- Hunt outputs include a prioritized list of hosts/process trees with supporting evidence (counts, example paths, timestamps).

## Potential False Positives / Tuning
- Legitimate admin tools that clear logs or stop services during maintenance windows.
- Bulk file operations by backup/archival/EDM tools that modify filenames.
- Developer or scripting activity that embeds base64 in command lines.
Tuning recommendations: process allowlists, path allowlists (Program Files, Windows\System32), business-hour maintenance windows, min file-count thresholds (e.g., ≥10 unique files).

## Response Suggestions
- Isolate impacted hosts (Windows/Linux) and the ESXi host if VM encryption is suspected.
- Triage for presence of ransom notes and sample encrypted files; preserve volatile memory where feasible.
- Block known LockBit 5.0 IoCs from TI feeds; sweep for persistence (Run/RunOnce keys, scheduled tasks).
- Review federation/single-sign-on and administrative credentials used on affected systems.
