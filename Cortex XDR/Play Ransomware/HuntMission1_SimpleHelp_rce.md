# Detection of Remote Code Execution via Exploited SimpleHelp RMM (CVE-2024-57727)

## Severity or Impact of the Detected Behavior
- **Risk Score:** 90
- **Severity:** High

## Hunt Analytics Metadata

- **ID:** HuntQuery-Cortex-SimpleHelpRMM-RCE
- **Operating Systems:** WindowsEndpoint, WindowsServer
- **False Positive Rate:** Medium

---

## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects suspicious process activity indicative of post-exploitation remote code execution via the SimpleHelp RMM tool, as observed in Play ransomware and affiliated IAB intrusions. The query identifies abnormal process launches from SimpleHelp service paths, command interpreters spawned from these locations, and encoded PowerShell or CMD payloads. Such behaviors are strongly associated with exploitation of public-facing applications (T1190), command and scripting interpreter abuse (T1059.001), and post-access lateral movement or persistence (T1078, T1133).

| Tactic                        | Technique   | Subtechnique | Technique Name                                            |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| TA0001 - Initial Access       | T1190       | —            | Exploit Public-Facing Application (SimpleHelp RMM Exploit)|

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies suspicious process activity related to SimpleHelp RMM exploitation:

- Process execution from SimpleHelp service paths or with command lines referencing SimpleHelp
- Command interpreters (PowerShell, cmd.exe) or encoded/obfuscated payloads
- Parent process is Java (java.exe or javaw.exe), as used by SimpleHelp

These patterns are commonly seen in post-exploitation remote code execution and lateral movement.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** XQL (Cortex Query Language)  
**Platform:** Polo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and XSIAM

```xql
// Title: SimpleHelp Java Process with Suspicious Command Line Activity
// Description: Detects Java processes associated with SimpleHelp directories or command lines, executing suspicious commands such as PowerShell, cmd.exe, or common post-exploitation techniques.
// MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID: T1219

| filter event_type = ENUM.PROCESS 
    and event_sub_type = ENUM.PROCESS_START

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |

| Cortex XSIAM|    xdr_data       | Process             | Process Creation       |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** Ability to collect process execution events from Windows endpoints.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process execution logs, command line arguments, parent/child process relationships.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the process path and command line for evidence of exploitation or encoded payloads.
- Validate the parent process and user context for additional signs of compromise.
- Correlate with other suspicious behaviors, such as network connections or file writes.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:
- Legitimate administrative or automation activity uses SimpleHelp for remote management.
- Internal IT scripts or software deployment tools invoke PowerShell or cmd.exe from SimpleHelp paths for benign reasons.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the process tree and command line for malicious indicators.
2. Validate the legitimacy of the SimpleHelp service and its configuration.
3. Review related process activity and user context.
4. Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
