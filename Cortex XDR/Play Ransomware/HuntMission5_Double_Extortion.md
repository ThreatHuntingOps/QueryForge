## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects key indicators of Play ransomware’s double extortion strategy. It focuses on ransom notes referencing email addresses ending in `@gmx.de` or `@web.de`, creation of files in commonly abused directories (e.g., `C:\Users\Public\Music\`), and file system modifications that align with post-encryption impact. The query also looks for ransom-related keywords and unique hashes to flag custom or obfuscated ransom notes.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies suspicious file creation and write activity related to Play ransomware double extortion:

- Creation of ransom notes in `C:\Users\Public\Music\` or any `ReadMe.txt` file
- File content containing ransom-related keywords, suspicious email domains, or .onion addresses
- Unique SHA256 hash per file to flag custom or obfuscated ransom notes

These patterns are commonly seen in ransomware campaigns involving double extortion and post-encryption impact.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** XQL (Cortex Query Language)  
**Platform:** Polo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and XSIAM

```xql
config case_sensitive = false
| dataset = xdr_data
| filter event_type = PROCESS
| filter actor_process_image_path contains "\\Users\\Public\\Music\\ReadMe.txt"
    or actor_process_image_path contains "\\ReadMe.txt"
| filter actor_process_image_name contains "@gmx.de"
    or actor_process_image_name contains "@web.de"
    or actor_process_image_name contains "ransom"
    or actor_process_image_name contains "payment"
    or actor_process_image_name contains "data leak"
    or actor_process_image_name contains ".onion"
| filter actor_process_image_sha256 != null
    and actor_process_image_name != ""
| fields agent_hostname, actor_process_image_path, actor_process_image_name, actor_process_image_sha256, event_timestamp
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Cortex XSIAM | xdr_data         | Process             | Process Creation       |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** Ability to collect file creation and write events from Windows endpoints.
- **Required Artifacts:** File creation logs, file content, file hashes, target file names.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the file path, content, and hash for evidence of ransom notes or double extortion indicators.
- Validate the user context and process responsible for file creation.
- Correlate with other suspicious behaviors, such as encryption or data exfiltration.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:
- Legitimate files contain similar keywords or are created in monitored directories for benign reasons.
- Internal IT or security tools generate files with ransom-related content for testing.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the file content, path, and hash for malicious indicators.
2. Validate the legitimacy of the file and its source.
3. Review related process activity and user context.
4. Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
