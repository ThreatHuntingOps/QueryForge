# Threat Hunting Hypothesis: Play Ransomware Activity (Based on CISA AA23-352A)

## Hypothesis Statement

Play ransomware actors are present in the environment and are likely to leverage valid accounts, exploit public-facing applications (including RMM tools like SimpleHelp), and use a combination of credential access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration techniques. These actors may deploy custom-compiled ransomware binaries, utilize double extortion tactics, and leave unique ransom notes referencing `@gmx.de` or `@web.de` email addresses. Evidence of their activity may be observable through:

- Unusual authentication or remote access activity (e.g., RDP, VPN, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities)
- Execution of tools such as AdFind, Grixba, GMER, IOBit, PowerTool, PsExec, Cobalt Strike, SystemBC, WinPEAS, WinRAR, WinSCP, and Mimikatz
- Creation of `.RAR` or `.PLAY` files, and ransom notes in atypical directories (e.g., `C:\Users\Public\Music\ReadMe.txt`)
- File system or process activity with unique hashes per deployment (indicative of custom or obfuscated binaries)
- ESXi-specific behaviors such as mass VM shutdown, encryption of VM-related files, and ransom note deployment in `/vmfs/volumes/` or `/root/`

## Purpose

This hypothesis guides the hunt to focus on identifying:
- Initial access via valid accounts or exploitation of public-facing applications
- Use of known Play ransomware TTPs and tools for discovery, defense evasion, lateral movement, and exfiltration
- Double extortion indicators, including ransom notes with specific email addresses and post-encryption threats
- ESXi and Windows-specific ransomware behaviors

## Characteristics of This Hypothesis
- **Specific and actionable:** Focuses on Play ransomwareâ€™s documented TTPs, IOCs, and unique operational patterns
- **Based on threat intelligence:** Directly informed by CISA AA23-352A and recent FBI/CISA/ASD reporting
- **Testable:** Can be validated through log analysis, process monitoring, file system forensics, and detection of IOCs and TTPs described in the advisory
