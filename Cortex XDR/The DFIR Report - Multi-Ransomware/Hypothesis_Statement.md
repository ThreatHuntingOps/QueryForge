## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of a sophisticated multi-ransomware affiliate intrusion involving Play, RansomHub, and DragonForce TTPs, this hypothesis targets the detection of advanced threat actors operating across multiple Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms. The hypothesis focuses on identifying the characteristic behavioral patterns of affiliates who leverage shared toolsets and techniques across different ransomware operations.

**Primary Hypothesis:** *Advanced ransomware affiliates operating in our environment will exhibit a specific sequence of behaviors including: (1) LOLBin abuse for initial execution and persistence, (2) systematic credential harvesting from backup infrastructure and Active Directory, (3) extensive network reconnaissance using renamed legitimate tools, and (4) data collection and staging activities using command-line archiving tools with specific parameter signatures.*

This hypothesis is designed to detect threat actors before ransomware deployment, focusing on the pre-encryption phases where intervention is most effective.

## Detailed Hypothesis Statement

### Core Hypothesis

**H1: Multi-RaaS Affiliate Detection**
Advanced threat actors affiliated with multiple ransomware operations (Play, RansomHub, DragonForce) are present in our environment and can be detected through their characteristic use of:

1. **Living-off-the-Land Binary (LOLBin) Execution Chains**: MSBuild.exe processes executing without command-line arguments, followed by network connections to external C2 infrastructure
2. **Systematic Credential Access**: Targeted harvesting of credentials from Veeam backup infrastructure, DCSync attacks, and LSASS memory access
3. **Reconnaissance Tool Masquerading**: Legitimate network scanning and AD enumeration tools renamed to mimic security products (e.g., Grixba as GT_NET.exe, SharpHound as sh.exe)
4. **Data Collection Signatures**: WinRAR execution with specific command-line parameters for large-scale data archiving

### Supporting Sub-Hypotheses

**H1.1: Initial Access Detection**
Threat actors will establish initial access through malicious executables masquerading as legitimate software, followed by MSBuild.exe execution without arguments and subsequent C2 communication.

**H1.2: Persistence and Privilege Escalation**
Actors will establish persistence through BITS transfers, startup folder shortcuts, and local administrator account creation, followed by PsExec execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**H1.3: Defense Evasion and Process Injection**
Malware will be injected into legitimate processes (MSBuild.exe) and metadata will be spoofed to impersonate security products.

**H1.4: Lateral Movement Patterns**
Actors will move laterally using RDP tunneling through proxy malware and WMI-based remote execution (wmiexec), targeting domain controllers and critical infrastructure.

## Supporting Threat Intelligence Rationale

### Intelligence Foundation

This hypothesis is grounded in detailed analysis of a September 2024 intrusion that demonstrated clear TTP overlap with three major ransomware operations:

- **Play Ransomware**: Grixba scanner usage (GT_NET/GRB_NET.exe)
- **RansomHub**: Betruger backdoor deployment with PsExec and wmiexec
- **DragonForce**: NetScan and SystemBC utilization

### Key Behavioral Indicators

1. **Unique Tool Signatures**: The combination of SystemBC proxy malware, Betruger backdoor, and SectopRAT represents a sophisticated toolkit rarely seen in commodity threats
2. **Infrastructure Patterns**: C2 communication over non-standard ports (9000, 15647) and use of bulletproof hosting providers
3. **Operational Security**: Systematic disabling of Windows Defender through registry modification and process injection for evasion
4. **Target Selection**: Focus on backup infrastructure (Veeam), domain controllers, and file servers indicates ransomware preparation

### Threat Actor Sophistication

The observed TTPs indicate a highly capable threat actor with:
- Advanced knowledge of Windows internals and Active Directory
- Access to custom malware and commercial tools
- Operational discipline in maintaining persistence and avoiding detection
- Experience across multiple RaaS platforms

## Testable Assumptions and Indicators

### Primary Testable Assumptions

**A1: LOLBin Execution Anomalies**
- MSBuild.exe processes without command-line arguments will be present
- These processes will establish network connections to external IP addresses
- Connection patterns will involve non-standard ports (9000, 15647, 443)

**A2: Credential Access Patterns**
- PowerShell execution containing "Veeam.Backup.Common.dll" strings
- DCSync network traffic from non-DC systems to domain controllers
- LSASS memory access by non-system processes

**A3: Tool Masquerading Behaviors**
- Legitimate tools (AdFind, SharpHound, Grixba) renamed with security product metadata
- Network scanning tools executed from unusual locations
- Output files with predictable names (list.txt, data.zip, sh.zip)

**A4: Data Collection Signatures**
- WinRAR execution with specific parameter sequence: "a -ep1 -scul -r0 -iext -imon1"
- Large archive creation (.rar files) in staging directories
- FTP traffic to external IP addresses over unencrypted connections

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Detection Rate**: Percentage of simulated attack scenarios detected
- **False Positive Rate**: Benign activities incorrectly flagged as malicious
- **Time to Detection**: Average time from initial compromise to alert generation
- **Coverage Completeness**: Percentage of attack phases with detection coverage

## Recommended Hunting Approach and Data Sources

### Hunting Methodology

**Phase 1: Baseline Establishment**
1. Establish normal MSBuild.exe execution patterns
2. Catalog legitimate network scanning activities
3. Document standard backup and administrative processes
4. Map typical RDP and WMI usage patterns

**Phase 2: Anomaly Detection**
1. Hunt for MSBuild.exe anomalies using process creation logs
2. Identify suspicious network connections from system processes
3. Search for renamed security tools and unusual file placements
4. Analyze PowerShell execution for credential access indicators

**Phase 3: Correlation and Investigation**
1. Correlate identified anomalies across multiple data sources
2. Investigate suspicious activities for additional context
3. Validate findings through endpoint forensics
4. Document lessons learned and refine detection logic

### Required Data Sources

**Essential Data Sources:**
- **Process Creation Logs**: Sysmon Event ID 1, Windows Event ID 4688
- **Network Connection Logs**: Sysmon Event ID 3, firewall logs, proxy logs
- **File Creation/Modification**: Sysmon Event ID 11, FIM solutions
- **Registry Modifications**: Sysmon Event ID 13, Windows Event ID 4657
- **Authentication Logs**: Windows Event IDs 4624, 4625, 4648

**Supplementary Data Sources:**
- **DNS Query Logs**: For C2 domain resolution detection
- **Email Security Logs**: For initial access vector identification
- **Endpoint Detection Response (EDR)**: For process injection and memory access
- **Network Flow Data**: For data exfiltration detection
