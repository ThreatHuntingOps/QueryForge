# Threat Hunt Hypothesis: Yurei Ransomware ("The Digital Ghost")

Source intelligence: [CYFIRMA - Yurei Ransomware: The Digital Ghost](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/yurei-ransomware-the-digital-ghost/)

## Hypothesis Statement
If Yurei ransomware operators have obtained valid credentials or access to our Windows environment, then we will observe a sequence of behaviors consistent with Yurei’s tradecraft - including PowerShell-driven backup/log destruction (vssadmin/wbadmin; recursive event log deletion), payload staging in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp, credential-based lateral execution (CIM/"PsExec-style"), propagation to writable SMB shares and removable media, and encryption artifacts (".Yurei" file extensions, per-file ChaCha20+ECIES headers with the “||” delimiter, and _README_Yurei.txt ransom notes) - resulting in inhibited recovery and rapid, network-wide data encryption.

## Why This Is Targeted and Actionable
- Based on fresh CTI detailing Yurei’s capabilities, IOCs, and TTPs observed in the wild.
- Maps to concrete telemetry across Windows endpoints, Active Directory, EDR, and network security logs.
- Defines explicit artifacts and queries that can confirm or refute the hypothesis.

## Threat Model and Assumptions
- Target OS: Windows endpoints and servers with SMB shares accessible.
- Likely initial foothold: Valid credentials or exposed admin surfaces enabling remote exec via PowerShell/CIM/SMB.
- Operator Objectives: Rapid impact through lateral spread and encryption; hinder IR via anti-forensics and recovery destruction; double extortion.

## Key Yurei Behaviors To Validate (from CTI)
- Encryption/Impact:
  - Appends “.Yurei” extension to encrypted files; writes _README_Yurei.txt per directory.
  - Per-file ChaCha20 keys wrapped with embedded ECIES public key; file header contains wrapped key + nonce separated by 0x7c7c ("||").
- Recovery Inhibition & Anti-Forensics:
  - PowerShell invocations of `vssadmin Delete Shadows /All /Quiet` and `wbadmin Delete Catalog -Quiet`.
  - Recursive deletion of Windows Event Logs (e.g., `%SystemRoot%\System32\winevt\Logs`), timestamp manipulation, console history cleanup.
- Staging & Propagation:
  - Payload and scripts staged in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp` and drive roots; filenames such as `WindowsUpdate.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `System32_Backup.exe`.
  - Lateral movement using PSCredential + CIM sessions, net use, and PsExec-style remote execution.
  - Copy to writable SMB shares; propagation via removable media (USB).
- Operator Comms:
  - Tor-based chat/blog links embedded in notes (onion domains/tokens) for victim tracking.

## Relevant MITRE ATT&CK Techniques (per CTI)
- Execution: T1047 (WMI), T1059 (PowerShell), T1106 (Native API)
- Persistence: T1543 / T1543.003 (Create/Modify System Process, Windows Service)
- Defense Evasion: T1027(.002), T1036, T1070(.004/.006), T1562(.001), T1564(.003/.004)
- Credential Access: T1003, T1552(.001)
- Discovery: T1012, T1016, T1057, T1082, T1497
- Collection: T1005, T1074, T1114
- C2: T1071, T1090
- Impact: T1485, T1486, T1489, T1490

## Data Sources and Signals
- Endpoint: EDR/AV telemetry, Sysmon, PowerShell logs (Module/ScriptBlock), Windows Event Logs, file creation/rename events, service creation.
- Identity: AD authentication logs, credential use anomalies.
- Network: SMB write events, lateral tool usage (PsExec/CIM), Tor/Onion indicators (proxy/egress).
- Storage/Backup: VSS/Backup service logs and command execution traces.

## Testable Questions and Validation Steps
1) Are there executions of backup/log destruction commands?
   - Look for process/command-line events invoking:
     - `vssadmin Delete Shadows /All /Quiet`
     - `wbadmin Delete Catalog -Quiet`
     - PowerShell with `Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Remove-Item -Force` targeting `winevt\Logs` or `%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs`
2) Do we see staging and suspicious file drops?
   - File creations in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp` and drive roots of `WindowsUpdate.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `System32_Backup.exe`.
   - Creation of `_README_Yurei.txt` and files ending in `.Yurei`.
3) Is there evidence of credential-based lateral movement?
   - PowerShell constructing `PSCredential`, opening `CIM` sessions, `net use \\*\IPC$` attempts, service creation for remote execution.
4) Are there encryption telemetry patterns?
   - Rapid, multi-host file rename/modify spikes; headers indicating ChaCha20+ECIES and `0x7c7c` delimiter.
5) Any Tor/Onion indicators from ransom notes or egress?
   - Outbound attempts to `.onion` (via proxies), or indicators embedded in notes.

## Example Hunt Analytics (pseudo/portable)
- PowerShell ScriptBlockText contains (`vssadmin Delete Shadows` OR `wbadmin Delete Catalog` OR (`Get-ChildItem` AND `winevt\\Logs` AND `Remove-Item`))
- New file create with Name endswith `.Yurei` OR equals `_README_Yurei.txt`
- File create with Name in (`WindowsUpdate.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `System32_Backup.exe`) AND Path in (drive root, writable SMB share)
- Process tree: powershell.exe -> (vssadmin.exe OR wbadmin.exe) OR network share writes
- Lateral exec: Event logs showing `PSCredential`, `New-CimSession`, `Invoke-Command`/remote service creation, or PsExec-like svc installs
- Surge of file modifications per host within short time intervals (encryption wave)

## Immediate Indicators of Compromise (from CTI)
- SHA256: `4f88d3977a24fb160fc3ba69821287a197ae9b04493d705dc2fe939442ba6461` (YureiRansomware.exe)
- SHA256: `1263280c916464c2aa755a81b0f947e769c8a735a74a172157257fca340e1cf4` (PowerShell fragment)
- Onion: `fewcriet5rhoy66k6c4cyvb2pqrblxtx4mekj3s5l4jjt4t4kn4vheyd.onion` (blog/chat per CTI)
- Note filename: `_README_Yurei.txt`
- Extension: `.Yurei`

## Decision Criteria
- Confirmed: ≥2 high-confidence behaviors plus encryption artifacts (e.g., `.Yurei` files and ransom notes) on ≥1 host, OR encryption telemetry + recovery inhibition commands observed.
- Inconclusive: Only single low-confidence signal (e.g., generic PowerShell usage) without corroborating artifacts.
- Refuted: No matching commands/artifacts across scoped hosts and timeframe after exhaustive search.

## Hunt Scope
- Timeframe: Past 30 days, with emphasis on last 7 days.
- Assets: All Windows endpoints/servers with SMB shares; domain controllers for credential/remote-exec telemetry.
- Privilege focus: Administrative sessions and service accounts with remote execution rights.

## Containment/Response Triggers (if confirmed)
- Isolate affected hosts; disable implicated accounts; rotate credentials.
- Block SMB egress and restrict inter-segment SMB; disable anonymous/share writes.
- Stop suspicious services/processes; collect volatile artifacts (within legal/IR guidance).
- Initiate restore from immutable/air-gapped backups; validate integrity pre-restore.

## Preventive Controls to Validate Post-Hunt
- Enforce MFA for admin and remote management pathways (RDP/CIM/PowerShell Remoting).
- Segment networks; limit SMB to known subnets; monitor SMB write anomalies.
- Regular, tested, segmented/immutable backups.
- EDR coverage for Yurei behaviors and IOCs; alert on `.Yurei` extensions and `_README_Yurei.txt` creation.
