# Detection of Common Process Launch Patterns for Cloudflare Tunnel WebDAV Access

## Severity or Impact of the Detected Behavior

## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects suspicious process launches involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`, or `cscript.exe` with command lines referencing `trycloudflare.com` and WebDAV-related terms. This pattern is characteristic of SERPENTINE#CLOUD operations, where attackers use common Windows processes to establish WebDAV connections to Cloudflare Tunnel infrastructure for payload delivery or command and control. Detected behaviors include:

- Process launches of common Windows interpreters or shells
- Command lines referencing `trycloudflare.com` and WebDAV operations (e.g., `webdav`, `DavWWWRoot`)

These techniques are associated with remote payload delivery, C2, and lateral movement.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies suspicious process launches by looking for:

- Process names matching `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`, or `cscript.exe`
- Command lines referencing `trycloudflare.com` and WebDAV-related terms (`webdav`, `DavWWWRoot`)

These patterns are indicative of attempts to leverage Cloudflare Tunnel infrastructure for remote payload delivery or C2.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** Falcon Query Language (FQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
// Title: Scripting/Command Process with trycloudflare.com and WebDAV/DAVWWWROOT Indicators
// Description: Detects cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe, or cscript.exe processes with command lines containing 'trycloudflare.com' and either 'webdav' or 'davwwwroot', which may indicate suspicious tunneling or remote file access.
// MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID: T1105

#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| event_platform = Win
| (FileName = "cmd.exe" OR FileName = "powershell.exe" OR FileName = "wscript.exe" OR FileName = "cscript.exe")
| CommandLine = "*trycloudflare.com*"
| (CommandLine = "*webdav*" OR CommandLine = "*davwwwroot*")
| table([@timestamp, EventTimestamp, ComputerName, UserName, FileName, FilePath, CommandLine, 
         EventID, AgentId, Product])
| sort(EventTimestamp)
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event Name                | ATT&CK Data Source | ATT&CK Data Component |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Falcon       | ProcessRollup2           | Process            | Process Creation      |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to execute command shells or scripting engines.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process creation logs, command-line arguments, and network connection records.

---

## Considerations

- Review the source and context of the process and command line for legitimacy.
- Correlate with user activity, email, or download logs to determine if the activity is user-initiated or automated.
- Investigate any network connections to `trycloudflare.com` domains for signs of malicious payload delivery or C2.
- Validate if the remote URL or WebDAV share is associated with known malicious infrastructure or threat intelligence indicators.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Users or IT staff legitimately use Cloudflare Tunnel and WebDAV for remote access or file transfer.
- Automated tools or scripts generate and execute these commands for benign purposes.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the process and command line for intent and legitimacy.
2. Analyze network connections to `trycloudflare.com` domains and WebDAV shares.
3. Review user activity and system logs for signs of compromise or C2.
4. Isolate affected endpoints if malicious activity is confirmed.
5. Block or monitor access to suspicious Cloudflare Tunnel domains and WebDAV shares.
