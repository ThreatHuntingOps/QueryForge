## Hunt Analytics

This is a high-fidelity hunt query that detects the specific command-line signature of the Chaos ransomware group's data exfiltration activity. The actor uses a tool masquerading as the legitimate Windows process `wininit.exe` (likely a renamed GoodSync executable) with a unique combination of arguments to filter and exfiltrate data. This query looks for the `wininit.exe` process name combined with key arguments like `--max-age`, `--exclude`, and `--multi-thread-streams`, making it a very specific and reliable indicator of this attack chain.

| Tactic                        | Technique   | Subtechnique | Technique Name                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| TA0010 - Exfiltration         | T1567       | .002         | Exfiltration Over Web Service: To Cloud Storage|
| TA0009 - Collection           | T1005       | —            | Data from Local System                         |
| TA0005 - Defense Evasion      | T1036       | .005         | Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location|

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies a highly specific exfiltration command by looking for:
- A process named `wininit.exe`.
- The simultaneous presence of command-line arguments (`copy`, `--max-age`, `--exclude`, `--multi-thread-streams`) that are characteristic of a data synchronization tool like GoodSync, but are completely alien to the legitimate `wininit.exe` process.

This combination of a legitimate system process name with illegitimate arguments is a strong indicator of masquerading.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** Falcon Query Language (FQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
// Title: Chaos RaaS Data Exfiltration via Masquerading GoodSync
// Description: Detects the specific command-line pattern used by Chaos RaaS to exfiltrate data using a tool masquerading as wininit.exe.
// MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID: T1567.002, T1036.005, T1005

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A      | ProcessRollup2   | Process             | Process Creation       |

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** The attacker must have permissions to place and execute the masquerading binary on the host.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process creation logs with full command-line argument visibility.

---

## Considerations

- **Extremely High Fidelity:** The legitimate `wininit.exe` process, located in `C:\Windows\System32`, does not accept these command-line arguments. Any match for this query is a strong indicator of compromise.
- **Key Artifacts:** The process path (`action_process_image_path`) is critical. If it is not `C:\Windows\System32\wininit.exe`, it confirms the masquerade. The command line itself will contain the source and destination of the exfiltration attempt.
- **Binary for Analysis:** The malicious `wininit.exe` binary should be collected for forensic analysis.

---

## False Positives

- False positives are highly unlikely. There are no known legitimate scenarios where the native `wininit.exe` process would be executed with these command-line flags.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1.  **Isolate Host:** Immediately isolate the host to prevent data exfiltration and further malicious activity.
2.  **Collect Artifacts:** Collect the masquerading `wininit.exe` binary (and its hash) for analysis.
3.  **Analyze Command:** Examine the full command line to identify the data targeted for collection and the exfiltration destination (e.g., an FTP server or cloud storage path).
4.  **Block Destination:** Immediately block the exfiltration destination at the network perimeter.
5.  **Investigate Causality:** Analyze the parent process to understand how the malicious binary was executed.
6.  **Hunt for Hash:** Hunt across the environment for the file hash of the malicious binary.
