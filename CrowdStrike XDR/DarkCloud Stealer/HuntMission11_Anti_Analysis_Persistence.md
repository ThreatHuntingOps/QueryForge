## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects suspicious processes performing anti-analysis checks (such as searching for analysis tools) and persistence mechanisms (such as modifying RunOnce registry keys), indicative of DarkCloud Stealer activity. The query also correlates these behaviors with DNS requests to public IP and geolocation services, which are commonly used for system information discovery.

Detected behaviors include:

- Execution of processes with command lines referencing analysis tools (Wireshark, Fiddler, Process Explorer, Procmon, TCPView, WinDbg, VMware Tools)
- Modification of the RunOnce registry key for persistence
- DNS requests to public IP and geolocation services (showip.net, mediacollege.com)
- Correlation of these activities on the same host and process

Such techniques are often associated with advanced malware seeking to evade detection and maintain persistence.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies:

- **Anti-Analysis Checks:** Processes with command lines referencing analysis tools.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** Modification of the RunOnce registry key.
- **System Information Discovery:** DNS requests to public IP and geolocation services.
- **Joins:** Correlates these events by agent ID (aid) and process ID (TargetProcessId) to accurately track the malicious activity chain.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
// Detect suspicious processes performing anti-analysis checks or persistence mechanisms

#event_simpleName="ProcessRollup2" 
| CommandLine=/Wireshark|Fiddler|Process Explorer|Procmon|TCPView|WinDbg|VMware Tools/i 
| join( 
    {#event_simpleName="RegistryValueSet" 
     | RegistryKey=/HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\.*/ 
    } 
    , field=TargetProcessId 
    , key=TargetProcessId 
    , include=[RegistryKey] 
) 
| join( 
    {#event_simpleName="DnsRequest" 
     | DomainName=/showip\.net|mediacollege\.com/i 
    } 
    , field=aid 
    , key=aid 
    , include=[DomainName] 
) 
| groupBy([aid, ComputerName], limit=max, function=collect([CommandLine, RegistryKey, DomainName])) 
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID         | Event Name         | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A              | ProcessRollup2     | Process             | Process Creation       |
| Falcon       | N/A              | RegistryValueSet   | Registry            | Registry Modification  |
| Falcon       | N/A              | DnsRequest         | Network             | DNS Request            |

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to execute processes, modify registry keys, and perform DNS requests.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process execution logs, registry modification logs, DNS request logs.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the source and legitimacy of processes referencing analysis tools or modifying persistence mechanisms.
- Analyze registry modifications for evidence of persistence.
- Review DNS requests for system information discovery or evasion techniques.
- Correlate activity with known DarkCloud Stealer indicators or threat intelligence.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Legitimate administrative or security tools reference analysis tools or modify RunOnce registry keys for benign purposes.
- Internal tools or automation interact with registry or DNS for compliance or monitoring.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the suspicious processes and their origin.
2. Analyze registry modifications and DNS requests for evidence of evasion or persistence.
3. Review command-line arguments and process ancestry for signs of anti-analysis or malware activity.
4. Monitor for additional signs of compromise or lateral movement.
5. Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
