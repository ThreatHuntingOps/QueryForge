## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects suspicious file drops associated with AutoIt droppers, specifically files with unusual naming conventions or extensions indicative of encrypted shellcode or XOR-encrypted payloads. This aligns with observed malware behavior, such as the dropping of files named "iodization" and "plainstones" or files with extensions like .001, .dat, or .bin, which are commonly used for storing encrypted or obfuscated payloads.

Detected behaviors include:

- Creation of files with suspicious names or extensions in user, system, or temporary directories
- Correlation of these file drops with the execution of AutoIt-compiled executables

Such techniques are often associated with advanced malware delivery, payload staging, and in-memory execution.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies:

- **Suspicious File Drops:** Files with known suspicious names ("iodization", "plainstones") or unusual extensions (.001, .dat, .bin) commonly used for encrypted payloads.
- **AutoIt Correlation:** Correlates these file drops with AutoIt executable processes to confirm malicious context.
- **Joins:** Matches file drop events with AutoIt execution events by agent ID (aid).

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
// Detect suspicious dropped files indicative of encrypted shellcode or XORed payloads

#event_simpleName="FileWritten" 
| TargetFileName=/iodization|plainstones|\.001$|\.dat$|\.bin$/i 
| FilePath=/C:\\Users\\.*|CSIDL_PROFILE\\.*|C:\\ProgramData\\.*|C:\\Windows\\Temp\\.*/
| join( 
    {#event_simpleName="ProcessRollup2" 
     | ImageFileName=/autoit.*\.exe/i OR CommandLine=/autoit.*\.exe/i 
    } 
    , field=aid 
    , key=aid 
    , include=[ImageFileName, CommandLine] 
) 
| groupBy([aid, ComputerName], limit=max, function=collect([TargetFileName, FilePath, ImageFileName, CommandLine])) 
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID         | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A              | FileWritten      | File                | File Creation          |
| Falcon       | N/A              | ProcessRollup2   | Process             | Process Creation       |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to execute AutoIt-compiled executables and write files to disk.
- **Required Artifacts:** File creation logs, process execution logs.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the source and contents of suspiciously named or formatted files.
- Validate the legitimacy of AutoIt-compiled executables associated with these file drops.
- Review file contents for evidence of encryption or obfuscation.
- Correlate activity with known malware indicators or threat intelligence.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Legitimate applications or scripts use similar file naming conventions or extensions for benign purposes.
- Internal tools or automation leverage these file types for legitimate operations.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the suspicious files and their origin.
2. Analyze associated AutoIt-compiled executables for malicious behavior.
3. Review file contents for encryption, obfuscation, or embedded payloads.
4. Monitor for additional signs of compromise or lateral movement.
5. Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
