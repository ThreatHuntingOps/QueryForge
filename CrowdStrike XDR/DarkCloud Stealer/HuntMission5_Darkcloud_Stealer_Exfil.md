## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects execution of the DarkCloud Stealer payload by identifying suspicious processes that access sensitive user data files, perform screenshot captures, and interact with browser or email client credential stores. These behaviors are consistent with the described functionalities of DarkCloud Stealer, including credential theft, screenshot capturing, and data exfiltration.

Detected behaviors include:

- Execution of processes containing the "DARKCLOUD" signature or suspicious executables
- Access to sensitive files such as browser credential databases, email client files, and FTP client files
- Screenshot capture activity by suspicious processes
- Correlation of these activities on the same host and process

Such techniques are often associated with advanced infostealer malware and data exfiltration campaigns.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies:

- **Payload Execution:** Processes containing the "DARKCLOUD" signature or suspicious executables.
- **Credential and Data Access:** Processes accessing sensitive files commonly targeted by infostealers (browser credential databases, email client files, FTP client files, etc.).
- **Screenshot Activity:** Processes performing screenshot captures, a common behavior of infostealers.
- **Joins:** Correlates these events by agent ID (aid) and process ID (TargetProcessId) to accurately track the malicious activity chain.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
// Detect suspicious processes indicative of DarkCloud Stealer payload execution

#event_simpleName="ProcessRollup2" 
| CommandLine=/DARKCLOUD/i OR ImageFileName=/\.exe$/i 
| join( 
    {#event_simpleName="FileOpen" OR #event_simpleName="FileWritten" 
     | TargetFileName=/Login Data|Cookies|Web Data|places\.sqlite|key4\.db|logins\.json|recentServers\.xml|\.xml$|\.db$|\.sqlite$/i 
     | FilePath=/C:\\Users\\.*|CSIDL_PROFILE\\.*|AppData\\.*|Local\\.*|Roaming\\.*/ 
     | join( 
         {#event_simpleName="ProcessRollup2" 
          | CommandLine=/screenshot|screen capture|PrintScreen|SnippingTool/i 
         } 
         , field=aid 
         , key=aid 
         , include=[CommandLine] 
       ) 
    } 
    , field=TargetProcessId 
    , key=TargetProcessId 
    , include=[TargetFileName, FilePath, CommandLine] 
) 
| groupBy([aid, ComputerName], limit=max, function=collect([ImageFileName, CommandLine, TargetFileName, FilePath])) 
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID         | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A              | ProcessRollup2   | Process             | Process Creation       |
| Falcon       | N/A              | FileOpen         | File                | File Access            |
| Falcon       | N/A              | FileWritten      | File                | File Creation          |

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to execute payloads and access sensitive files.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process execution logs, file access logs, screenshot activity logs.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the source and legitimacy of processes containing the "DARKCLOUD" signature.
- Analyze accessed files for evidence of credential or data theft.
- Review screenshot activity for signs of data exfiltration.
- Correlate activity with known DarkCloud Stealer indicators or threat intelligence.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Legitimate applications access sensitive files or perform screenshot captures for benign purposes.
- Internal tools or automation interact with credential stores or user data files.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the suspicious processes and their origin.
2. Analyze accessed files and screenshot activity for malicious behavior.
3. Review command-line arguments and process ancestry for signs of infostealer activity.
4. Monitor for data exfiltration or C2 communications.
5. Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
