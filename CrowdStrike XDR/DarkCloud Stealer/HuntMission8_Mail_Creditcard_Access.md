## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects suspicious processes accessing sensitive mail client data files and files potentially containing credit card information, indicative of DarkCloud Stealer activity. The query specifically filters out legitimate mail client and browser processes to focus on unauthorized or suspicious access attempts.

Detected behaviors include:

- Access to mail client data files (.pst, .ost, .mbox, .eml, .msg) and browser data files potentially containing credit card information (.sqlite, .db, .json, LoginData, aData)
- Correlation of these file access events with non-mail client and non-browser executable processes

Such techniques are often associated with infostealer malware and credential or data theft campaigns.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies:

- **Mail Client and Credit Card Data Access:** Access to sensitive mail client data files and browser files potentially containing credit card information.
- **Suspicious Process:** Filters out legitimate mail client and browser processes to identify unauthorized access.
- **Joins:** Correlates file access events with suspicious processes by agent ID (aid) and process ID (TargetProcessId).

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
// Detect suspicious processes accessing mail client data and credit card information

#event_simpleName="FileOpen" OR #event_simpleName="FileWritten" 
| TargetFileName=/\.pst$|\.ost$|\.mbox$|\.eml$|\.msg$|LoginData|aData|\.sqlite$|\.db$|\.json$/i 
| FilePath=/\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook\\.*|\\AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderbird\\Profiles\\.*|\\AppData\\Local\\Mail\\.*|\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mail\\.*|\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\.*|\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\.*/ 
| join( 
    {#event_simpleName="ProcessRollup2" 
     | ImageFileName=/\.exe$/i 
     | NOT (ImageFileName=/outlook\.exe|thunderbird\.exe|chrome\.exe|firefox\.exe|msedge\.exe/i) 
    } 
    , field=TargetProcessId 
    , key=TargetProcessId 
    , include=[ImageFileName, CommandLine] 
) 
| groupBy([aid, ComputerName], limit=max, function=collect([TargetFileName, FilePath, ImageFileName, CommandLine])) 
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID         | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A              | FileOpen         | File                | File Access            |
| Falcon       | N/A              | FileWritten      | File                | File Creation          |
| Falcon       | N/A              | ProcessRollup2   | Process             | Process Creation       |

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to access mail client and browser data files and execute processes.
- **Required Artifacts:** File access logs, process execution logs.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the source and legitimacy of processes accessing mail client and browser data files.
- Analyze command-line arguments and process ancestry for evidence of credential or data theft.
- Correlate activity with known DarkCloud Stealer indicators or threat intelligence.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Legitimate security tools or backup utilities access mail client or browser data files for benign purposes.
- Internal tools or automation interact with mail or browser data for compliance or migration.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the suspicious processes and their origin.
2. Analyze accessed files for evidence of credential, email, or credit card data theft.
3. Review command-line arguments and process ancestry for signs of infostealer activity.
4. Monitor for additional signs of compromise or lateral movement.
5. Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
