## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects suspicious processes accessing browser databases or files potentially containing stored credit card information, indicative of DarkCloud Stealer activity. The query specifically filters out legitimate mail client and browser processes to focus on unauthorized or suspicious access attempts.

Detected behaviors include:

- Access to browser and mail client data files (.sqlite, .db, .json, LoginData, aData, .pst, .ost, .mbox, .eml, .msg) in Chrome, Firefox, Outlook, Thunderbird, and other user data directories
- Correlation of these file access events with non-mail client and non-browser executable processes

Such techniques are often associated with infostealer malware and credential or credit card data theft campaigns.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies:

- **Credit Card Data Access:** Access to browser and mail client data files potentially containing stored credit card information.
- **Suspicious Process:** Filters out legitimate mail client and browser processes to identify unauthorized access.
- **Joins:** Correlates file access events with suspicious processes by agent ID (aid) and process ID (TargetProcessId).

---

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
// Detect suspicious processes accessing mail client data and credit card information

#event_simpleName="FileOpen" OR #event_simpleName="FileWritten" 
| TargetFileName=/\.pst$|\.ost$|\.mbox$|\.eml$|\.msg$|LoginData|aData|\.sqlite$|\.db$|\.json$/i 
| FilePath=/\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook\\.*|\\AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderbird\\Profiles\\.*|\\AppData\\Local\\Mail\\.*|\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mail\\.*|\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\.*|\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\.*/ 
| join( 
    {#event_simpleName="ProcessRollup2" 
     | ImageFileName=/\.exe$/i 
     | NOT (ImageFileName=/outlook\.exe|thunderbird\.exe|chrome\.exe|firefox\.exe|msedge\.exe/i) 
    } 
    , field=TargetProcessId 
    , key=TargetProcessId 
    , include=[ImageFileName, CommandLine] 
) 
| groupBy([aid, ComputerName], limit=max, function=collect([TargetFileName, FilePath, ImageFileName, CommandLine])) 
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID         | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A              | FileOpen         | File                | File Access            |
| Falcon       | N/A              | FileWritten      | File                | File Creation          |
| Falcon       | N/A              | ProcessRollup2   | Process             | Process Creation       |

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to access browser and mail client data files and execute processes.
- **Required Artifacts:** File access logs, process execution logs.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the source and legitimacy of processes accessing browser and mail client data files.
- Analyze command-line arguments and process ancestry for evidence of credential or credit card data theft.
- Correlate activity with known DarkCloud Stealer indicators or threat intelligence.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Legitimate security tools or backup utilities access browser or mail client data files for benign purposes.
- Internal tools or automation interact with browser or mail data for compliance or migration.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the suspicious processes and their origin.
2. Analyze accessed files for evidence of credential or credit card data theft.
3. Review command-line arguments and process ancestry for signs of infostealer activity.
4. Monitor for additional signs of compromise or lateral movement.
5. Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
