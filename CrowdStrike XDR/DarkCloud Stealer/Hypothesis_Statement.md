# Hypothesis Statement: DarkCloud Stealer Threat Hunt

## Background

Recent threat intelligence from [Unit 42](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/darkcloud-stealer-and-obfuscated-autoit-scripting/) highlights a new attack chain involving the DarkCloud Stealer malware. This campaign leverages obfuscated AutoIt-compiled executables, distributed primarily via phishing emails containing malicious RAR archives or PDFs. The malware is designed to evade traditional detection, extract sensitive data (such as browser credentials, email, FTP, and credit card information), and establish command and control (C2) communications.

## Hypothesis Statement

**If** endpoints within the environment have received phishing emails containing RAR archives or PDFs that lead to the download and execution of AutoIt-compiled executables,  
**then** it is likely that at least one system has been infected with a DarkCloud Stealer variant, resulting in the exfiltration of sensitive credentials and data to external C2 infrastructure.

## Purpose

This hypothesis will guide the hunt to:

- Identify evidence of phishing emails delivering RAR or PDF attachments.
- Detect execution of AutoIt-compiled PE files, especially those with obfuscated scripts and bundled encrypted payloads.
- Search for indicators of credential theft, data exfiltration, and C2 communications associated with DarkCloud Stealer.

## Characteristics

- **Specific and actionable:** Focuses on a defined attack chain (phishing → AutoIt EXE → credential theft).
- **Based on threat intelligence:** Directly informed by Unit 42’s published research and observed TTPs.
- **Testable:** Can be validated through email gateway logs, endpoint execution telemetry, file analysis, and network traffic monitoring.

## Testable Questions

- Are there email logs showing delivery of RAR or PDF attachments matching known DarkCloud Stealer indicators?
- Do endpoint logs show execution of AutoIt-compiled executables, especially those matching known hashes or exhibiting obfuscation?
- Is there evidence of credential access, browser data theft, or suspicious outbound connections to known C2 infrastructure?
