## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects a sequence of behaviors associated with credential access and data viewing. It identifies when `notepad.exe` is used to view the output file generated by Mimikatz (e.g., `Result.txt`), indicating that credentials dumped from LSASS memory are being accessed and reviewed.

Detected behaviors include:

- Execution of `notepad.exe` with command-line arguments referencing `Result.txt`
- Correlated execution of `mimikatz.exe` on the same host
- Correlation of these events by asset ID, indicating credential dumping and viewing

Such activity is a strong indicator of credential access and post-exploitation activity by an attacker.

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies when `notepad.exe` is used to view the output file generated by Mimikatz, a strong indicator of credential access activity.

---

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
// Outer query: notepad.exe execution    
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2    
| FileName="notepad.exe"    
| CommandLine=/Result\.txt/i    
| join(    
  {    
    // Inner query: mimikatz.exe execution on same host    
    #event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2    
    | FileName="mimikatz.exe"    
  }    
  , field=aid    
  , key=aid    
  , include=[FileName]    
)    
| groupBy([aid, ComputerName], limit=max, function=collect([FileName, CommandLine]))    
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID         | Event Name             | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A              | ProcessRollup2         | Process             | Process Creation       |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** Attacker must be able to execute code as notepad and Mimikatz.
- **Required Artifacts:** Process creation logs, process context correlation.

---

## Considerations

- Validate the context of the notepad and Mimikatz execution to reduce false positives.
- Confirm that the activity is not part of legitimate security testing or troubleshooting activity.
- Review additional process and network activity for signs of further exploitation or lateral movement.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Security teams or administrators are conducting legitimate penetration testing or troubleshooting.
- Internal scripts or monitoring tools use similar patterns for automation or diagnostics.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Isolate the affected endpoint or server from the network if unauthorized credential access is detected.
2. Investigate the source and intent of the notepad and Mimikatz execution.
3. Review all processes associated with the tools for further malicious activity.
4. Hunt for additional indicators of compromise across the environment.
5. Patch vulnerable systems and review endpoint security controls.
