# Threat Hunting Hypothesis Statement: Elpaco Team Ransomware Targeting Confluence Servers

## Hypothesis Statement

Adversaries associated with the Elpaco Team ransomware group are actively exploiting unpatched or vulnerable Atlassian Confluence servers within the environment to gain initial access, establish persistence, and deploy ransomware payloads, as observed in recent incidents reported by threat intelligence sources.

## Purpose

This hypothesis aims to guide a focused threat hunt to identify evidence of exploitation attempts, unauthorized access, and post-exploitation activities related to Confluence servers, ensuring timely detection and mitigation of ransomware threats.

## Rationale

- **Specific and Actionable:** The hypothesis targets a known attack vector (Confluence servers) and a specific threat actor (Elpaco Team ransomware), enabling targeted data collection and analysis.
- **Based on Threat Intelligence:** Recent reporting ([DFIR Report, May 2025](https://thedfirreport.com/2025/05/19/another-confluence-bites-the-dust-falling-to-elpaco-team-ransomware/#case-summary)) details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Elpaco Team, including exploitation of Confluence vulnerabilities, credential dumping, lateral movement, and ransomware deployment.
- **Testable:** The hypothesis can be tested by analyzing server logs, endpoint telemetry, network traffic, and authentication records for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and behaviors consistent with the described attack chain.

## Investigation Scope

- Review Confluence server logs for signs of exploitation (e.g., suspicious HTTP requests, exploitation of known CVEs).
- Analyze authentication logs for anomalous access patterns or credential misuse.
- Search for known Elpaco Team IOCs, such as specific malware hashes, C2 domains, or file artifacts.
- Investigate lateral movement and privilege escalation activities following initial access.
- Monitor for ransomware deployment behaviors and data exfiltration attempts.
