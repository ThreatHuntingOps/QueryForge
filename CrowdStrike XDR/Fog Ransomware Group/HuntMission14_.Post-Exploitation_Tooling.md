# Detection of Post-Exploitation Tooling and Syteca Activity Associated with Fog Ransomware Operations

## Severity or Impact of the Detected Behavior
- **Risk Score**: 85
- **Severity**: High

## Hunt Analytics Metadata
- **ID**: HuntQuery-CrowdStrike-FogRansomware-Syteca
- **Operating Systems**: WindowsEndpoint, WindowsServer
- **False Positive Rate**: Medium

## Hunt Analytics
This hunt detects suspicious activity related to the deployment and use of open-source post-exploitation tools (GC2, Stowaway, Adaptix C2), the Syteca (Ekran) monitoring tool, and evidence removal attempts. Detected behaviors include:

- Execution of Syteca binaries from non-standard locations
- Use of regsvr32 to load Syteca DLLs
- Process termination commands targeting Syteca
- Lateral movement via PsExec/SMBExec
- Use of file transfer and archiving utilities for data theft
- Suspicious service creation for persistence

Such techniques are consistent with the tradecraft observed in the referenced Fog ransomware incident and may indicate post-exploitation, data theft, or anti-forensic activity.

## ATT&CK Mapping

| Lateral Movement | T1021.002 | — | Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares |
| Persistence | T1569.002 | — | System Services: Service Execution |
| Defense Evasion | T1070.004 | — | Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion |
| Exfiltration | T1105 | — | Ingress Tool Transfer |
| Credential Access | T1003 | — | OS Credential Dumping |
| Discovery | T1047 | — | Windows Management Instrumentation |

| Command and Control | T1071.001 | — | Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols |
| Defense Evasion | T1036 | — | Masquerading |

## Hunt Query Logic
This query identifies suspicious process executions and command lines associated with:

- Syteca/Ekran client binaries and DLLs
- regsvr32 loading Syteca DLLs
- Process termination targeting Syteca/Ekran
- Uninstallers for Syteca/Ekran
- Lateral movement via PsExec/SMBExec
- GC2/Adaptix/Process Watchdog/Backdoor binaries
- File transfer and archiving utilities
- Suspicious service creation for persistence

These patterns are often seen in post-exploitation, data theft, and anti-forensic operations by advanced threat actors and ransomware operators.

## Data Sources
| Log Provider | Event ID | Event Name | ATT&CK Data Source | ATT&CK Data Component |
|--------------|----------|------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon | N/A | ProcessRollup2        | Process             | Process Creation |
| Cortex XSIAM | xdr_data              | Process             | Process Creation     

## Execution Requirements
- **Required Permissions**: Attacker or user must be able to execute binaries and scripts on the endpoint.
- **Required Artifacts**: Process creation logs, command-line arguments, file path information.

## Considerations
- Investigate the source and hash of any detected Syteca/Ekran binaries.
- Review command-line arguments for evidence of anti-forensic or lateral movement activity.
- Correlate with file transfer and archiving tool usage for signs of data theft.
- Validate any suspicious service creation for persistence mechanisms.
- Cross-reference with threat intelligence for known IOCs and infrastructure.

## False Positives
False positives may occur if:

- Syteca/Ekran is legitimately deployed and managed in your environment.
- System administrators use PsExec, SMBExec, or file transfer tools for routine operations.
- Security or IT teams perform legitimate process or service management.

## Recommended Response Actions
- Investigate the origin and intent of detected binaries and services.
- Analyze command-line arguments and parent-child process relationships.
- Review for evidence of data exfiltration or credential access.
- Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
- Remove unauthorized tools and restore system integrity.
