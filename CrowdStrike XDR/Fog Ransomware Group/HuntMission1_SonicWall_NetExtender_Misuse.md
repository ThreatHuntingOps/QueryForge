## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects suspicious usage of the `netExtender` command-line utility for SonicWall VPNs, particularly when automated scripts are used for account validation and internal port scanning. The query identifies command-line patterns consistent with credential-stuffing or reconnaissance activity, such as the use of `data.txt` for credential input and `nmap` for network discovery. These behaviors are indicative of attackers leveraging stolen VPN credentials to gain unauthorized access and map internal networks, as observed in recent Fog ransomware affiliate campaigns.

| Tactic                        | Technique   | Subtechnique | Technique Name                                              |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| TA0006 - Credential Access    | T1078       | —            | Valid Accounts (use of stolen credentials)                  |
| TA0007 - Discovery           | T1046       | —            | Network Service Discovery (via nmap)                        |

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies suspicious executions of the SonicWall NetExtender utility that match multiple indicators:

- Use of command-line arguments for username, password, domain, and always-trust
- File names and command lines referencing `netextender`, `data.txt`, `sonic_scan`, or `nmap`
- Patterns consistent with automated credential validation and internal reconnaissance

These patterns are often seen in credential-stuffing, initial access, and lateral movement phases of targeted attacks.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** Falcon Query Language (FQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2  
| ((CommandLine=/netExtender*/i AND CommandLine="*--username*" AND CommandLine="*--password*" AND CommandLine="*--domain*" AND CommandLine="*--always-trust*") OR 
(CommandLine=/net_extender*/i AND CommandLine="*--username*" AND CommandLine="*--password*" AND CommandLine="*--domain*" AND CommandLine="*--always-trust*")) 
| (FileName=/netextender.exe*/i OR FileName=/netextender*/i OR FileName=/net_extender*/i)  
| (CommandLine="*data.txt*" OR CommandLine="r" OR CommandLine="*sonic_scan*" OR CommandLine="*nmap*")  
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A      | ProcessRollup2   | Process             | Process Creation       |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to execute NetExtender and run scripts on the endpoint.
- **Required Artifacts:** Command-line logs, process creation events, credential files (e.g., data.txt), and network scan artifacts.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the source and contents of `data.txt` for evidence of credential-stuffing.
- Review the context of NetExtender usage, including parent process and user account.
- Correlate with VPN logs for anomalous access patterns or geolocations.
- Examine for follow-on activity such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Administrators are legitimately using NetExtender for bulk VPN access testing or network discovery.
- Internal IT automation scripts use similar command-line patterns for maintenance.
- Security or compliance tools perform scripted VPN access validation.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the initiating script or process and its source.
2. Analyze command-line arguments and credential files for malicious indicators.
3. Review VPN and network logs for unauthorized access or scanning activity.
4. Isolate affected systems if confirmed malicious.
5. Reset compromised credentials and review access policies.
