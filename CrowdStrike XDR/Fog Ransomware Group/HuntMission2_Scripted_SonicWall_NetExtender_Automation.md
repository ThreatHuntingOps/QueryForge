## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects potentially automated abuse of the SonicWall NetExtender VPN utility when executed via Python scripts, such as `main.py`, using stolen credentials from `data.txt` and followed by internal reconnaissance with `nmap`. The query specifically identifies suspicious parent-child process chains (Python ➝ NetExtender and NetExtender ➝ nmap), which are strong indicators of script-driven credential-stuffing and network scanning activity. These behaviors are consistent with attacker automation observed in recent ransomware affiliate campaigns.

| Tactic                        | Technique   | Subtechnique | Technique Name                                              |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| TA0006 - Credential Access    | T1078       | —            | Valid Accounts (use of stolen credentials)                  |
| TA0002 - Execution           | T1059.006   | —            | Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python                   |

| TA0007 - Discovery           | T1046       | —            | Network Service Discovery (via nmap)                        |

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies:

- Python as the parent process of NetExtender, indicating script-based VPN access
- NetExtender as the parent of nmap, indicating automated internal scanning
- Command-line arguments for credential stuffing and campaign artifacts (e.g., `sonic_scan`, `data.txt`)
- Patterns consistent with attacker automation and reconnaissance

These process chains and command-line patterns are rarely seen in legitimate administrative activity and are strong indicators of malicious automation.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** Falcon Query Language (FQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2  
| ((ParentBaseFileName="python.exe" OR ParentBaseFileName="python") AND (FileName=/netextender.exe/i OR FileName=/netextender/i))  
| (CommandLine="*--username*" AND CommandLine="*--password*" AND CommandLine="*--domain*" AND CommandLine="*--always-trust*")  
| (CommandLine="*sonic_scan*" OR CommandLine="*data.txt*")  
| (ParentBaseFileName=/netextender.exe/i OR ParentBaseFileName=/netextender/i) AND (FileName="nmap.exe" OR FileName="nmap")    
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A      | ProcessRollup2   | Process             | Process Creation       |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to execute Python scripts and NetExtender, and run network scanning tools.
- **Required Artifacts:** Command-line logs, process creation events, credential files (e.g., data.txt), and network scan artifacts.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the source and contents of `data.txt` and any associated Python scripts.
- Review the context of NetExtender and nmap usage, including parent process and user account.
- Correlate with VPN logs for anomalous access patterns or geolocations.
- Examine for follow-on activity such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Administrators are legitimately automating VPN access and network discovery for IT operations.
- Internal security or compliance tools use similar automation for testing or monitoring.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the initiating Python script and its source.
2. Analyze command-line arguments and credential files for malicious indicators.
3. Review VPN and network logs for unauthorized access or scanning activity.
4. Isolate affected systems if confirmed malicious.
5. Reset compromised credentials and review access policies.
