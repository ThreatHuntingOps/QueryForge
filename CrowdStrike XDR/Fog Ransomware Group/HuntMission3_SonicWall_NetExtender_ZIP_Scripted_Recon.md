## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects the full attack chain starting from ZIP file extraction (e.g., `sonic_scan.zip`) to the scripted execution of SonicWall NetExtender with stolen credentials and internal reconnaissance via `nmap`. The query identifies key indicators such as ZIP unpacking, creation of automation files (`main.py`, `data.txt`), suspicious parent-child process relationships (Python ➝ NetExtender ➝ nmap), and the use of common temp or download directories. These behaviors are highly indicative of credential abuse and automated reconnaissance as seen in recent ransomware affiliate campaigns.

| Tactic                        | Technique   | Subtechnique | Technique Name                                              |

| TA0006 - Credential Access   | T1078       | —            | Valid Accounts (use of stolen credentials)                  |

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies:

- Creation of key files (`main.py`, `data.txt`) after ZIP extraction
- Use of common temp or download directories for unpacked files
- Python as the parent process of NetExtender, and NetExtender as the parent of nmap
- Command-line arguments for credential stuffing and campaign artifacts (e.g., `sonic_scan`, `data.txt`)
- Patterns consistent with full attack chain automation and reconnaissance

These indicators, when observed together, are rarely seen in legitimate administrative activity and are strong signals of malicious automation and credential abuse.

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** Falcon Query Language (FQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
#event_simpleName=FileCreate OR #event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2 // ZIP file extraction detection  
| (FileName="main.py" OR FileName="data.txt") | (ParentBaseFileName="explorer.exe" OR ParentBaseFileName="python.exe" OR ParentBaseFileName="powershell.exe")  
| (FilePath="*\\Temp\\*" OR FilePath="*\\Downloads\\*" OR FilePath="*\\AppData\Local\\Temp\\*" OR FilePath="*sonic_scan*") // Python executing NetExtender  
| ((#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2 AND ParentBaseFileName="python.exe") AND (FileName="netextender.exe" OR FileName="netextender"))  
| (CommandLine="*--username*" AND CommandLine="*--password*" AND CommandLine="*--domain*" AND CommandLine="*--always-trust*") 
| (CommandLine="*sonic_scan*" OR CommandLine="*data.txt*") // NetExtender spawning nmap  
| ((ParentBaseFileName=/netextender.exe/i OR ParentBaseFileName=/netextender/i) AND (FileName="nmap.exe" OR FileName="nmap")) 
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A      | FileCreate       | File                | File Creation          |
| Falcon       | N/A      | ProcessRollup2   | Process             | Process Creation       |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must be able to extract ZIP files, execute Python scripts, run NetExtender, and use network scanning tools.
- **Required Artifacts:** File creation logs, process creation events, credential files (e.g., data.txt), and network scan artifacts.

---

## Considerations

- Investigate the source and contents of ZIP files and any extracted scripts or credential files.
- Review the context of NetExtender and nmap usage, including parent process and user account.
- Correlate with VPN logs for anomalous access patterns or geolocations.
- Examine for follow-on activity such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Administrators are legitimately automating VPN access and network discovery for IT operations using ZIP-packaged scripts.
- Internal security or compliance tools use similar automation for testing or monitoring.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Investigate the initiating ZIP file, extracted scripts, and their sources.
2. Analyze command-line arguments and credential files for malicious indicators.
3. Review VPN and network logs for unauthorized access or scanning activity.
4. Isolate affected systems if confirmed malicious.
5. Reset compromised credentials and review access policies.
