# Threat Hunting Hypothesis: Fog Ransomware Affiliate – Multi-Stage Intrusion via Compromised VPN Credentials

## Hypothesis Statement

**There is a possibility that one or more systems within our environment have been compromised by a threat actor leveraging compromised SonicWall VPN credentials, followed by the use of advanced post-exploitation toolkits (including Sliver C2, AnyDesk, DonPAPI, Certipy, and privilege escalation exploits such as Zer0dump and noPac), consistent with tactics observed in recent Fog ransomware affiliate operations.**

## Rationale

This hypothesis is based on the following threat intelligence from The DFIR Report (April 2025):

- Initial access is achieved using valid credentials for SonicWall VPN appliances, often obtained via credential theft or scanning.
- The attacker deploys a toolkit for reconnaissance, credential access (DonPAPI, dpapi.py), and exploitation of Active Directory vulnerabilities (Certipy, Zer0dump, Pachine, noPac).
- Persistence is established using AnyDesk, with automated installation and preconfigured credentials via PowerShell.
- Command and control is maintained through Sliver C2 and Proxychains, enabling stealthy lateral movement and remote access.
- The attacker targets organizations across multiple industries and geographies, with a focus on technology, education, logistics, and retail sectors.
- Victim data and evidence of compromise are often found in open directories and are later published on ransomware leak sites.

## Testable Actions

To test this hypothesis, threat hunters should:

- Search VPN logs for anomalous or unauthorized SonicWall VPN logins, especially from unusual geolocations or at odd hours.
- Detect the presence or execution of tools such as Sliver, AnyDesk, DonPAPI, Certipy, Zer0dump, Pachine, and noPac on endpoints or servers.
- Monitor for PowerShell scripts that automate remote access tool installation or credential configuration.
- Hunt for evidence of lateral movement via SMB/Windows Admin Shares and Proxychains tunneling.
- Investigate for signs of credential theft, privilege escalation, and suspicious modifications to Active Directory or certificate services.
- Look for outbound connections to known or suspicious C2 infrastructure, especially Sliver C2 servers.
