## Technical description of the attack  
This hunt targets the use of PowerShell to enumerate and compress potentially sensitive files before exfiltration. Common in post-exploitation scenarios, adversaries use PowerShell commands such as `Get-ChildItem` combined with `Compress-Archive` to gather document files like `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.xlsx`, which are then prepared for transfer.

## Detection description  
This hunt identifies PowerShell processes that use both `Get-ChildItem` and `Compress-Archive` in the command line while specifying document-type extensions. This behavior is indicative of automated file discovery and packaging, often preceding exfiltration attempts.

---

## Considerations  
Context is crucial to reducing false positives. Focus on suspicious paths (e.g., user folders, external drives) and uncommon user accounts performing the action. Fields like `ParentBaseFileName`, `CommandLine`, and `UserSid` should be reviewed closely.

---

## False Positives  
Legitimate IT automation or backup scripts might use similar PowerShell commands. Cross-reference with scheduling patterns, known admin tools, and user roles to validate benign behavior.

---

## Suggested Response Actions  
- Investigate source script or binary responsible for launching the PowerShell command.  
- Review file paths accessed and compressed.  
- Determine whether the archive was written to removable media or uploaded over the network.  
- Monitor for subsequent network connections or data transfer.  
- If malicious, isolate endpoint and examine lateral movement or staging activity.
