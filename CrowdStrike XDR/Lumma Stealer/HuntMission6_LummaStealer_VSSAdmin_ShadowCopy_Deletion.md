## Technical description of the attack
Ransomware groups (e.g., Black Basta) often delete shadow copies before encrypting files to prevent recovery. This behavior is frequently executed using `vssadmin.exe` with flags like `delete shadows` or `create shadow` to either remove or manipulate volume shadow copies. If Lumma is used as a dropper or loader, this activity may appear as part of the post-compromise stage.

## Permission required to execute the technique
Administrator

## Detection description
This query flags suspicious uses of `vssadmin.exe` to either delete or manipulate shadow copies, often from within user-accessible directories or system paths. While these may occur during legitimate backup/restore operations, the context of execution and timing are key for triage.

---

## Considerations
Use additional fields such as `CommandLine`, `ParentProcessId`, and `UserSid` to add context. Review adjacent process activity (e.g., backup software or script runners) to identify false positives. Pair this rule with detections for `rundll32`, `wscript`, or `powershell` to enhance fidelity.

---

## False Positives
Backup management tools or legitimate administrative scripts may invoke `vssadmin` with these parameters. Whitelist known and expected usage patterns (e.g., enterprise backup software agents).

---

## Suggested Response Actions
- Confirm process lineage and user context.
- Review system for signs of encryption, unauthorized changes, or dropped payloads.
- Search for indicators of ransomware staging or communication with known C2 endpoints.
- Isolate host and collect forensic images immediately.
- Validate whether Lumma or another loader was present prior to the execution.
