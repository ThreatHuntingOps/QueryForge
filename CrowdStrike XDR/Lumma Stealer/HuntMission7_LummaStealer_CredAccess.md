## Technical description of the attack
Lumma Stealer is a known infostealer malware that targets credential stores and browser login data following initial infection. It commonly attempts to access sensitive files such as Chrome's `Login Data`, Firefox profile databases, and Edge credential stores. These are high-value targets that may contain saved usernames, passwords, session tokens, or browser-stored credentials.

---

## Permission required to execute the technique
User (with access to browser or local app data)

---

## Detection description
This hunt detects access to known credential store paths across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge by potentially malicious processes such as `wscript.exe`, temporary script runners (`*.tmp`), or `.js` files. These patterns align with behavior observed in Lumma Stealer campaigns seeking credential theft post-compromise.

---

## Considerations
File access alone may not indicate compromiseâ€”correlate with process ancestry, file hashes, and execution context. Consider filtering known safe access (e.g., from legitimate password managers or backup agents).

---

## False Positives
Some enterprise tools (e.g., profile migration utilities, legitimate backup software) may access browser credential stores. Validate based on the initiating process and organizational software inventory.

---

## Suggested Response Actions
- Analyze and triage the accessing process for malicious indicators.
- Check for exfiltration activity or outbound connections.
- Isolate affected endpoint.
- Revoke or rotate credentials if theft is confirmed.
- Hunt across the environment for similar file access patterns.
