# Threat Hunting Hypothesis: Lumma Stealer via Fake CAPTCHA Campaign

## Hypothesis Statement

**It is plausible that one or more systems within our organization have been compromised by the Lumma Stealer malware, delivered through fake CAPTCHA pages that deceive users into executing malicious commands. This infection vector may have led to the unauthorized extraction of sensitive information, including credentials, browser data, and cryptocurrency wallet details.**

## Rationale

This hypothesis is grounded in the following threat intelligence indicators and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) identified in the referenced analysis:

- **Social Engineering via Fake CAPTCHA Pages**: Attackers employ deceptive CAPTCHA prompts to trick users into executing malicious scripts, initiating the malware download process.

- **Use of Legitimate-Looking Scripts**: The malicious commands are often obfuscated within scripts that appear legitimate, increasing the likelihood of user execution.

- **Data Exfiltration Capabilities**: Once installed, Lumma Stealer is capable of extracting a wide range of sensitive data, including:
  - Stored browser credentials and cookies
  - Cryptocurrency wallet information
  - System and network information

- **Evasion Techniques**: The malware employs various methods to evade detection, such as:
  - Obfuscation of code to hinder analysis
  - Use of common file names and locations to blend in with legitimate system files

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: The analysis provides specific IoCs, including file hashes and domain names, associated with the Lumma Stealer campaign.

## Testable Actions

To validate this hypothesis, the following actions are recommended:

1. **User Behavior Analysis**:
   - Review user activity logs for instances of script execution following interactions with CAPTCHA prompts.

2. **Endpoint Inspection**:
   - Scan systems for the presence of known IoCs related to Lumma Stealer, including specific file hashes and registry modifications.

3. **Network Traffic Monitoring**:
   - Analyze outbound network traffic for connections to domains and IP addresses identified as C2 servers in the campaign.

4. **Credential Audit**:
   - Conduct a thorough audit of stored credentials and browser data on endpoints to detect unauthorized access or exfiltration.

By undertaking these actions, we aim to detect and mitigate potential compromises resulting from the Lumma Stealer fake CAPTCHA campaign.
