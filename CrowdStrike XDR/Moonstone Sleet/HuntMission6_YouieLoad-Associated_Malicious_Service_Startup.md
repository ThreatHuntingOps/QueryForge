# Detection of YouieLoad-Associated Malicious Service Startup

## Severity or Impact of the Detected Behavior
- **Risk Score:** 90
- **Severity:** High

## Hunt Analytics Metadata

- **ID:** HuntQuery-CrowdStrike-YouieLoadService
- **Operating Systems:** WindowsEndpoint, WindowsServer
- **False Positive Rate:** Low to Medium

---

## Hunt Analytics

This hunt detects the start of malicious services associated with the YouieLoad malware. Such services may be created during persistence or post-exploitation phases of an attack, enabling attackers to maintain access or execute additional payloads. The detection logic focuses on service names or service paths referencing `youieload`, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity linked to this malware family.

Such behavior is indicative of system process creation, service execution, and new service installation, all of which are commonly abused by attackers for persistence and privilege escalation.

## ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic                        | Technique   | Subtechnique | Technique Name                                         |
|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| TA0004 - Privilege Escalation| T1543.003   | —            | Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service       |
| TA0002 - Execution           | T1035       | —            | Service Execution                                      |
| TA0003 - Persistence         | T1050       | —            | New Service                                            |

## Hunt Query Logic

This query identifies suspicious service startups by detecting:

- Service name matching `youieload` (case-insensitive)
- Service path containing `youieload`

These patterns are commonly seen in attacks where malware establishes persistence or executes payloads via malicious services.

---

## Hunt Query Syntax

**Query Language:** CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL)  
**Platform:** CrowdStrike Falcon

```fql
#event_simpleName=ServiceStart  
| ServiceName = /youieload/i OR ServicePath = "*youieload*"   
```

## Data Sources

| Log Provider | Event ID | Event Name       | ATT&CK Data Source  | ATT&CK Data Component  |
|--------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Falcon       | N/A      | ServiceStart     | Service             | Service Start          |

---

## Execution Requirements

- **Required Permissions:** User or attacker must have rights to create or start Windows services.
- **Required Artifacts:** Service creation and start logs, service path information.

---

## Considerations

- Validate the legitimacy of the detected service and its associated binary.
- Investigate the service creation context for signs of persistence or privilege escalation.
- Correlate with other endpoint or network alerts for post-exploitation activity.

---

## False Positives

False positives may occur if:

- Legitimate software or internal tools use service names or paths containing `youieload` for benign purposes.
- Security testing or red team activities mimic these behaviors.

---

## Recommended Response Actions

1. Review and validate the legitimacy of the detected service and its binary.
2. Analyze the service binary for malicious content or persistence mechanisms.
3. Investigate user and process activity around the time of service creation or start.
4. Remove unauthorized or malicious services if confirmed.
5. Update detection rules and threat intelligence with new indicators as needed.
