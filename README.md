# QueryForge ðŸ”¥  
*Forging powerful detection engineering content for threat hunters and defenders.*  

---

ðŸ“– **Overview**  
QueryForge is a curated collection of **threat hunting queries, analytics, and correlation rules** for platforms such as **CrowdStrike Falcon XDR**, **Palo Alto Cortex XDR**, and **Palo Alto XSIAM**.  

The repository helps defenders go **beyond outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box detections** by:  
- Developing **hypothesis-driven hunts**,  
- Running targeted investigations,  
- Engineering **advanced correlation rules** for proactive detection,  
- Continuously adapting content against **real-world adversaries**.  

---

ðŸŽ¯ **Threat Hunting & Detection Engineering Approach**  
Each campaign follows a structured methodology:  

1. **Hypothesis** â€“ a testable assumption about adversary techniques.  
2. **Hunt Missions & Queries** â€“ analytic-driven searches across endpoint/XDR datasets.  
3. **Detection Engineering** â€“ translation into **correlated detection content**.  
4. **Validation & Iteration** â€“ refining coverage against evolving adversary tradecraft.
